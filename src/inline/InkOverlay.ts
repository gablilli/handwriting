/**
 * Ink on the ordinary Obsidian editor.
 *
 * A CM6 ViewPlugin mounts three viewport-sized canvases over the editor
 * (committed / wet / live-head tail, the same layering the approved canvas
 * pipeline uses) and claims only pen input, in capture phase, on the editor's
 * scroller. The editor underneath is untouched: typing, selection, links,
 * touch scrolling and caret placement remain native CodeMirror/Obsidian.
 *
 * Coordinates are NOTE-SURFACE coordinates (the settled OneNote model):
 * origin at the top-left of the Markdown content column, y absolute down the
 * document, zoom 1. Markdown flows however Obsidian wants; ink stays where
 * the pen physically put it; editing Markdown never moves ink. The existing
 * Camera does the mapping with its state pinned to
 *   (overlayLeft − contentLeft, overlayTop − documentTop, zoom 1),
 * so every reused renderer works unmodified.
 *
 * The pen hot path is the frozen pipeline verbatim: synchronous draw inside
 * `pointerrawupdate`, coalesced samples, live raw head + smoothed tail. The
 * only editor-derived values it touches are two numbers cached at pen-down.
 * Scroll/reflow repaints of committed ink are rAF-throttled and never run
 * during a stroke's wet path.
 *
 * Ink is keyed by file path in the session and persisted by InlineInkStore
 * under the note's page id; the eraser, lasso and history live on this
 * surface too. An untouched note stays untouched by construction: nothing is
 * written until the first stroke commits. Ink renders above the text; nothing
 * here bakes that in (a z-order field per stroke group can arrive later
 * without moving a single coordinate).

	 * The two above watch `.cm-editor` and `.cm-content`, and the Minimal
	 * theme holds both of them perfectly still while it moves the column.
	 * Minimal forces `.cm-content` to `width: 100%` and centres the LINE
	 * divs inside it (theme.css 9.0.2:1852-1867), so Readable line length,
	 * the theme's own `--line-width` setting and a per-note `cssclasses:
	 * wide` each re-centre the text without changing `.cm-content`'s box at
	 * all. Measured in `test/render/MinimalResync.test.ts`: on a note of
	 * short lines all three move the column by more than a pixel while
	 * `editorRO`, `contentRO` and `metadataMO` fire zero times between them.
	 * The camera then keeps its stale origin until the user scrolls or puts
	 * the pen down - so a user who changes a setting and LOOKS sees the ink
	 * sitting off the words, which is what samuelbits reported against the
	 * real 1.4.9.
	 *
	 * WHY THE LINE'S SIZE AND NOT A CLASS. The same measurement scored the
	 * cheaper candidates: a class MutationObserver on `.markdown-source-view`
	 * caught two of the three and missed both `--line-width` routes outright
	 * (a custom property moves the column with no class change anywhere), and
	 * a `<style>` observer on `document.head` caught only the injected route.
	 * The line's rendered size is downstream of ALL of them, so this trigger
	 * does not care how a theme or a settings plugin delivers the change.
	 * Widening `metadataObserver`'s `attributeFilter` was rejected outright:
	 * it is registered with `subtree: true`, so a class filter would fire on
	 * every `cm-activeLine` toggle - a callback per cursor move whose record
	 * array grows with the edit batch.
	 *
	 * A ResizeObserver sees size, not position, so it still misses a column
	 * that moves at CONSTANT line width - a sidebar while `width:
	 * var(--line-width)` is the binding that decides, where the line neither
	 * moves nor resizes but the editor does. That one is the editor
	 * observer's, and `handleResize`'s origin compare already covers it.
	 * Minimal declares `--content-margin` exactly once (theme.css:1832, as
	 * `auto`), so for this theme as shipped the pair is complete.

		// document top had NONE, and that was a real defect rather than a
		// theoretical one. CodeMirror's `viewState.paddingTop` is 0 until its
		// first measure cycle, and Obsidian's inline title, its properties
		// block and any font swap all sit ABOVE `.cm-content` and settle on
		// their own schedule - so on a fresh mount the top moves at a fixed
		// scroll position, and something above `.cm-content` growing does not
		// RESIZE `.cm-content`, `.cm-editor` or the watched `.cm-line`. No
		// observer fires. The camera then adopted the new top at the next
		// sync for any reason, NOTHING repainted, and committed ink went on
		// being drawn where the old top put it - so the eraser probed where
		// the ink is not, found nothing, and returned silently on a page
		// whose store is not empty (alan, relaying the owner, 1.4.11).
		//
		// AGAINST `lastPaintCam`, AND NOT AGAINST `lastSyncDocumentTop`. The

		// .getBoundingClientRect().top + paddingTop`, which CodeMirror
		// documents as going negative when the editor is scrolled down. It
		// moves by the whole delta on every scroll, so comparing it directly
		// would ask for a repaint on every scrolled frame - and, with a via
		// that asserts damage, a full re-rasterization of every visible
		// stroke plus an index rebuild per frame, on a plugin that runs on
		// e-ink. Measured against the tests below, that cut asked for twelve
		// repaints where this one asks for two. The camera origin is that
		// number minus the band's own rect top, and the band lives INSIDE the
		// scroller, so both terms move together and the origin is exactly
		// still through a scroll. It moves when the anchor really moved,
		// which is the event this is for.
		//
		// `lastPaintCam` is the camera the committed layer was last drawn
		// with (set in `repaint`, cleared when a reallocation blanks the
		// canvases), so this compares what the pixels say against what the
		// camera now says - exactly, and on the same three fields `repaint`
		// uses to decide the same question one step later. Absent means
		// nothing has been painted yet, and nothing painted cannot be stale;
		// truthiness rather than `!== null` because the prototype-built
		// fixtures that exercise this method leave the field off entirely,
		// and "no recorded paint" is the right reading of that too.
		//
		// "scroll" as the via ON PURPOSE. It asserts no damage and does not
		// dirty the index (the index is in world space; the camera cannot
		// stale it), and `repaint` upgrades ANY camera motion to a full

		// exactly when one is needed, and costs an empty callback when this

	 * length scrolling the overlay under that frozen rect, and NOTHING

	 * pan would be mapped through a rect stale by the entire pan - a ring that
	 * lands the whole scroll distance away from the pen. `refreshRect()`
	 * closes that, and it is safe here where it is not mid-gesture: the router
	 * clears `activePenId` BEFORE calling `onPenUp`, so no frozen camera is

	 * No event, no RESTORE - but the rect is refreshed either way, which is

	 * mid-pan: alt-tab, a system dialog) ends the gesture with no lift and

	 * it back - and that next hover has to be mapped through a rect that

	 * A live gesture was torn down inside the router with no pointerup: a

	 *
	 * The blur twin of update()'s path-change branch, which is where each of
	 * these lines comes from - the same stale state, reached without a switch,
	 * and the branch that repairs it can never run because no path changed.
	 *
	 * NOT THE WINDOW BLUR ANY MORE (alan, 2026-09-04: "alt tab mid stroke -
	 * sure make it consistent"). A blur mid-stroke now COMMITS what was drawn,
	 * through the router's `finishActiveStroke()` -> `onPenUp` -> `penUp()`,
	 * which is the rule `docs/manual.md` already states for the pdf viewer
	 * rebuilding under the pen. What this method is FOR is the teardown that
	 * really does DROP a stroke - a note switch, where the editor is already
	 * showing a different note and the old note's fragment has nowhere to
	 * land. The pdf surface's twin carries the same split for the same reason.
	 *
	 * Nothing reaches it today, and that is worth saying out loud rather than
	 * leaving for a reader to discover with a grep. Its only caller is
	 * `onStrokeAbandoned`, and the router's one remaining call site for that
	 * callback (the blur handler's second branch) can only run when no stroke
	 * was live, which is exactly when `abandonActiveStroke()` returns false.
	 * The note switch that WOULD want this runs the same teardown inline
	 * instead - `update()`'s path-change branch: `resetGestureState()`, then
	 * `stripPenUp` gated on the boolean, then the wet/tail clears and the
	 * highlighter opacity. Kept as a method, kept wired, and kept executed by
	 * `AbandonedGestureStandsDown.test.ts`, because the callback's contract is
	 * "a stroke was really torn down" and a future caller of that branch could
	 * satisfy it; on the pdf the twin is live code, called by `forgetHistory`.
	 *
	 * The strip first. Such a teardown happens inside the router, where the
	 * `stripPenDown` the contact ran left `is-inking` on the strip and its
	 * collapsed pill (styles.css: opacity 0 AND visibility hidden, so
	 * unhit-testable) until some later stroke completed. Deliberately not
	 * `penUp()`, which commits ink - and committing is exactly what a dropped
	 * stroke must not do.
	 *
	 * THEN THE SURFACE'S OWN STATE, which the chrome-only version left
	 * untouched for two releases. `builder` stays live, the half-drawn stroke
	 * stays painted on the wet layer over a note nobody drew it on, and -
	 * worst of the three because it outlives the gesture - the stroke frame
	 * stays LOCKED, which freezes the camera and every repaint until the next
	 * pen-down (the v0.13.6 lifecycle rule `resetGestureState` states in its
	 * own header). The pdf surface has the identical body under the identical

	// of the content column: an invisible 1×1 spacer inside the scroller,
	// positioned at (note origin + granted extent) in scroller-content
	// coordinates, extends scrollWidth/scrollHeight so native scrolling
	// (finger, touchpad, scrollbar) reaches all of it. Obsidian ships the
	// scroller with `overflow-x: hidden`, so the axis guard flips exactly
	// that property to `auto` while ink needs it.
	//
	// This is the one piece of Handwriting that changes what SCROLLING itself can
	// do, and wheel input (the touchpad pipeline) can pan a scrollable x-axis
	// that an axis-locked touch drag never touches. That made it the first
	// suspect in the 2026-08 touchpad dead-zone investigation, which is why
	// every mutation here is traced.
